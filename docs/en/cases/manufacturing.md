# Case: Auto Manufacturer - Supply Chain Data Governance ðŸš—

## Customer Background

The enterprise is a large automotive manufacturer with annual production of 500,000 vehicles, over 300 suppliers, managing 100,000+ SKU materials.

## Business Challenges

**1. Chaotic Material Data**

-   ERP, MES, WMS, SRM and other systems have inconsistent material codes
-   Material master data (description, specifications, suppliers) inconsistent
-   Chaotic new material creation process, high duplicate creation rate
-   Poor material data quality, affecting procurement and production

**2. Difficult Supply Chain Collaboration**

-   Incomplete supplier data, difficult to assess and manage
-   Inaccurate inventory data, leading to both inventory backlog and stockouts
-   Production plans frequently adjusted due to data issues
-   Slow supply chain response, long delivery cycles

**3. Difficult Cost Control**

-   Unable to accurately analyze material cost composition
-   Repeatedly purchasing the same material, losing bargaining power
-   Slow inventory turnover, occupying large amounts of capital

**4. Limited Business Expansion**

-   Slow new product launch: Material data preparation time-consuming
-   New factory construction: Difficult data migration and synchronization
-   Merger and acquisition integration: Inconsistent data standards

## Solution

### Phase 1: Material Master Data Governance (6 months)

-   Unified material coding rules: Hierarchical coding including category, attributes, serial number
-   Clean historical material data: Deduplication, standardization, completion
-   Deploy Informatica MDM to manage material master data
-   Establish material creation approval process: R&D proposes, procurement reviews, master data team creates

### Phase 2: Supplier Master Data Management (3 months)

-   Integrate supplier data from SRM, ERP, quality systems
-   Establish supplier unique code
-   Complete supplier profile: Qualifications, capabilities, performance evaluation
-   Implement supplier lifecycle management

### Phase 3: Data Quality Management (3 months)

-   Define 200+ material and supplier data quality rules
-   Deploy data quality monitoring: Real-time check of newly created and changed data
-   Establish data quality KPIs and accountability system
-   Data quality issue handling process

### Phase 4: Data Integration & Synchronization (4 months)
