# Case: Tier-3 Hospital - Medical Data Unified Management 🏥

## Customer Background

The hospital is a large comprehensive tertiary-level hospital with 2,000 beds, 3 million annual outpatient visits, and 150,000 inpatients.

## Business Challenges

**1. Serious Data Silos**

-   HIS (Hospital Information System), LIS (Laboratory System), PACS (Imaging System), EMR (Electronic Medical Record) and other 10+ systems are independent
-   Patients have different IDs in different systems, unable to correlate
-   Doctors need to log into multiple systems to view complete patient information, inefficient

**2. Data Quality Issues**

-   Patient basic information (name, ID, contact) has high duplication and error rates
-   Key clinical data such as test results and diagnostic information incomplete
-   Historical medical record scans cannot be queried structurally

**3. Insufficient Clinical Decision Support**

-   Cannot quickly obtain complete patient visit history
-   Lack of data to support clinical pathways and quality control
-   Difficult to conduct clinical research and medical statistics

**4. Data Security Compliance**

-   Patient privacy data lacks effective protection
-   Medical staff permission management crude
-   Difficult to meet cybersecurity level protection and medical data security standards

## Solution

### Phase 1: Patient Master Index (EMPI) Construction (4 months)

-   Integrate patient data from all systems
-   Establish patient unique identifier (Patient Master Index)
-   Implement patient matching algorithm: Multi-dimensional matching based on name, ID, phone number
-   Historical data cleaning and deduplication
-   Matching accuracy reached 99.5%

### Phase 2: Clinical Data Repository (CDR) Construction (6 months)

-   Establish integration platform (HL7/FHIR standards)
-   Real-time collection of all business system data
-   Establish clinical data repository, unified storage of structured clinical data
-   Implement data quality rules and monitoring

### Phase 3: Data Security & Privacy Protection (3 months)

-   Patient privacy data classification: Identify all data containing patient names, IDs, medical records
-   Implement fine-grained permission control: Medical staff can only access data of patients under their care
-   Data masking: Automatic masking of data in research and training environments
-   Audit logs: Record all patient data access

### Phase 4: Clinical Decision Support (3 months)

-   Establish patient 360-degree view: Integrate all information including outpatient, inpatient, laboratory, examination, medication
-   Develop doctor workstation plugin: Embed complete patient information in existing systems
-   Clinical pathway management: Monitor clinical pathway execution based on data
-   Medical quality indicator monitoring: Real-time calculation and monitoring of quality control indicators
