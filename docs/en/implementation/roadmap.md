# Data Governance Implementation Guide

Successfully implementing data governance requires a systematic approach and phased advancement strategy. This guide provides actionable steps and best practices to help your enterprise establish an effective data governance system.

::: tip Core Principles
Data governance is a continuous journey, not a one-time project. It is recommended to adopt a **progressive** and **iterative** implementation approach, starting with small-scale pilots and gradually expanding.

-   **Maturity Score**: Maturity scores for each dimension

### 1.2 Strategic Planning

Based on assessment results, formulate data governance strategy.

#### Define Objectives

Set SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):

**Example Objectives:**

-   ✅ Within 12 months, core business data quality accuracy reaches 98% or above
-   ✅ Within 6 months, 100% of sensitive data implements access control and encryption
-   ✅ Establish enterprise-level data catalog covering 80% of key data assets
-   ✅ Achieve GDPR compliance and pass external audit

#### Determine Scope

**Recommended to start small:**

-   Select 1-2 business domains for pilot (e.g., customer data, product data)
-   Focus on the most painful data quality issues
-   Choose scenarios with high impact and moderate complexity

#### Secure Support

Data governance requires high-level support and cross-departmental collaboration:

-   Report to senior management to secure resource support
-   Identify Executive Sponsor
-   Form cross-departmental advancement team
-   Develop communication plan to manage change

#### Budget Planning

Typical data governance project cost structure:

| Cost Item             | Percentage | Description                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Labor Costs**       | 40-50%     | Project team, consulting services, training     |
| **Tools & Platforms** | 30-40%     | Data catalog, data quality, MDM and other tools |
| **Infrastructure**    | 10-15%     | Servers, storage, network                       |
| **Other**             | 5-10%      | Travel, office, external audit                  |

::: warning Budget Recommendations

-   Small and medium enterprises: $500K - $1.5M
-   Large enterprises: $2M - $5M+
-   Remember to reserve 20% contingency budget
    :::

#### Technology Selection Recommendations

**Open Source vs Commercial:**

| Option          | Advantages                                        | Disadvantages                                  | Suitable Scenarios                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Open Source** | Low cost, high flexibility, community support     | Requires technical skills, complex integration | Strong technical capabilities, limited budget |
| **Commercial**  | Complete features, good support, rapid deployment | High cost, vendor lock-in                      | Quick results, sufficient budget              |
| **Hybrid**      | Balance cost and functionality                    | High architectural complexity                  | Most enterprises                              |

**Recommended Combinations:**
